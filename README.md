# GPT Dialogue Demo

A quick demo of GPT integration with Unity3D to create a dialogue system. The project features a simple UI, with some graphics created by myself and others generated using Midjourney (it's relatively easy to distinguish which is which). The project was created in Unity3D version 2022.2.13.

## Installation

- Download Unity3D version 2022.2.13
- Clone the repository

## Usage

- Open the project in Unity3D
- Enter your OpenAI API key in the Component "*GPTAPIClient*" located in the GameObject called "*Conversation Controller*"

- Run the project

## Features

- Few different avatars and backgrounds
- The ability to customize the chat by giving it a name, choosing the age, gender, language of communication (**English and Polish available in demo**), specifying the personality traits to guide it during response generation, and providing a background story for the character
- The option to refine the "*Rules of Engagement*", which are a set of rules the chat should follow during the conversation. These rules are sent along with the first message, which also includes the aforementioned personality traits necessary for building the character
- The ability to enter questions in a text field and confirm them using the button to the right of the text field or by pressing "**Enter**"/"**Return**"
- Between the avatar and the text field, there are four buttons whose text is also generated by GPT and should be suggested hints for the "player" to ask questions that move the conversation forward. However, it is currently possible that the first prompt (building the chat character) is treated as general knowledge available to the player as well, causing the generated suggested auxiliary questions to contain information that has not yet been officially revealed to the player. **This could be due to an underdeveloped first prompt, or it could be a limitation of the language model used in the demo**.

## Costs

As you can see in the screenshot below, the demo was tested for two days - I think it's safe to assume that the **number of tests (and thus the API calls) was similar on both days, but the size of the first prompt was not**.

On the first day, the first prompt was just a handful of tokens (about 180-200 in total), but now it looks like this:

- "prompt_tokens": 702
- "completion_tokens": 187
- "total_tokens": 889

This translates to a quite significant increase in costs: from **$0.03** to **$0.21**, which means an **increase of 600%**.
